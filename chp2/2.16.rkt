;The problem is due to the fact that algebraic equivalence like A/A=1 is not true at all
;The problem of A/A can be solved recognizing equal intervals and returning one in this case
;The solution in general is to find a set of algebraic equivalence that guarantees that equivalent algebraic equivalences are true
;and to implement this set of cases
